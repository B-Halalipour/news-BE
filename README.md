# NC News Seeding

- .env.development
  Create a .env.development file in your project folder and add the followings:
  PGDATABASE=nc_news
  This connects your application to the main development database

- .env.test
  Create a .env.test file in the same directory and add
  PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
  This ensures your tests run against a separate test database called nc_news_test, so your development data remains unaffected.
